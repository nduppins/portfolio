    <p>My name is Nasir Duppins. I am fifteen years old and I live in philadephia, pennsylvania. My favorite genres is rap
      and op and my favorite artist is travis scott. My favorite subject is science and I want to be an engineer when I grow
      up. The high school I currently go to is Science Leadership Academy Center City.
    </p>
    <p>My future goal is to be an engineer but I don't know what type yet. I choose to be an engineer because I like to do hands
      on activities. I like to think about building new things to help make the world more efficient. People like when I
      put my creatitivity together because they think one day it will happen. So, when I go to college I want to get my masters
      and docorate in engineering and in science.
