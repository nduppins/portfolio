    <p>My name is Nasir Duppins. I am fifteen years old and I live in philadephia, pennsylvania. My favorite subject is science and I want to be an engineer when I grow
      up. The high school I currently go to is Science Leadership Academy Center City.
    </p>
    <p>My future goal is to be an engineer but I don't know what type yet. I choose to be an engineer because I like to do hands
      on activities. Some of my earliest memories involved Legos. I love building things and imagine myself in an engineering career. 
      I got into the  CTE engineering program at my school which will give me three years of specialized science coursework in preparation for college. 
      I also got into SMASH@Wharton summer STEM academy which is a three years long scholarship program.  
      Lucky for me the wave of careers in the near future will require professionals who have specialized in STEM!
