########

Assignment: Add an image to your About Me page and edit the CSS so the image and paragraphs are side-by-side.

Grade:  60

Comment: You included the image, but since I don't have your file I can't confirm its working... I see you started to use floats to put the image and paragraphs side by side, but that part isn't working.

I did note a few things as TODO items in your code.   You can view them by clicking the ToDo Tree icon on the left of your VS Code window.

Assignment: Use Google Forms to add a contact form to your page.

Grade: 85

Comment:  You got this in early, good job, but the form is broken... it looks like you have the link broken up in to multiple lines, which caused the problem.

You had this:

src=
    "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLS
    cIkbn1x8rYC-x77GKNXZlcI1_nxpSw2z0jmarWWwszeFswvQ/viewform?
    embedded=true"

and it needed to be this:

src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIkbn1x8rYC-x77GKNXZlcI1_nxpSw2z0jmarWWwszeFswvQ/viewform?embedded=true"

(I know it probably wraps to multiple lines, but that's just the way it's displayed... it's all one long line.  Try clicking [Alt]+Z and see the line wrapping change.)
